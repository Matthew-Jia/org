K -> default behavior is trigger keywordprg (Keyword Program), which essentially just search up the man page, but most lsps override it to vim.lsp.hover and vim docs will override it to their own internal version of keywordprg to search for their own documentation of the word.
KK -> if K is bound to vim.lsp.hover, jump into the hover page
